*"Turns out this planet doesn't have light! ...or something like that."*
+ If active, the map will be pitch dark, with the only light sources being actors and teleporters.
+ Feeling lost? Use ``blinding_easy_mode`` to double your vision radius and make all map objects emit light.

*"Don't you just love those missiles Providence fires? Seems like he got some range increases and now he's sniping you from his ship!"*
+ If active, after 10 seconds on any stage, a barrage of missiles will target every player on the map. If you're hit straight on, you die. If you're lucky, you can narrowly escape with only taking some damage...
+ Can't dodge? Use ``bombardment_easy_mode`` to make missiles leave you at 1HP instead of straight up killing you.

*"You know that planet on *Interstellar* that has tidal waves going around all the time? Yeah, that."*
+ If active, after 10 seconds on any stage, there's a chance of a tidal wave that pushes players spawning from either side of the screen. If you get caught between two opposing waves you get *Wave Crashed* for 5 seconds. While *Wave Crashed*, waves will have no effect on you, but your speed and armor gets cut by half.
+ Are enemies behind waves killing you while your armor is down? Use ``flood_easy_mode`` to disable *Wave Crashed*'s debuffs.
